## What is Web Scraping ??<br/>
Web scraping, web harvesting, or web data extraction is data scraping used for extracting data from websites.
<br/>Web scraping is a process of automating the extraction of data in an efficient and fast way. With the help of web scraping, you can extract data from any website, no matter how large is the data, on your computer. 

## Why web scraping is used?<br/>

### Competitor Price Monitoring 
<br/>In this era of e-commerce, price plays a key role. You need to keep track of competitor pricing strategies.
<br/>However, it is not possible to visit every website and check for the same. Web scraping comes to their rescue here.
<br/>With the help of web scraping, manufacturers can easily and effectively monitor MAP compliance. They can do it without having to spend an enormous amount of time as web scraping can produce this data in a lightening quick fashion.<br/>


### Monitoring Consumer Sentiment
<br/>It is necessary to track and analyze consumer sentiment. It is done by reviewing consumer feedback and reviews of different businesses.
<br/>However, getting all the reviews from different websites in a manual way is not feasible.
<br/>Therefore, web scraping is leveraged to make it stunningly easy. With web scraping, you can get all the reviews on a spreadsheet and even compare different reviews based on keywords.
